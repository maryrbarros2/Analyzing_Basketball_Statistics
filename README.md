P/ descrição do Github Cortar isso:  In this Jupiter Notebook, I created the following:  1. Defined a Web Scraping Function, returning a dictionary corresponding to the Regular season statistics of each basketball player scraped from m en.wikipedia.org.

Plot the Points per game for a player using the function plt.plot()
